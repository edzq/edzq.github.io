HiðŸ‘‹, my name is Qi Zhang (å¼ æ£‹) I am currently a Computer Science Phd Candidate at Computer & Information Sciences Department of Temple University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Eduard Dragut](https://cis.temple.edu/~edragut/index.htm).

My primary research interests are centered around natural language processing, large language models and machine learning. 
Specifically, I am working on developing information extraction models under low-resource scenarios using cost-effective techniques such as weak/distant supervision, semi-supervised learning, and in-context learning.

I am/was the research assistant for several NSF funded projects, including:
- Extracting and Linking AI Artifacts
- Knowledge Graph to Support Evaluation and Development of Climate Models
- America's Fourth Estate at Risk: A System for
Mapping the (Local) Journalism Life Cycle to Rebuild the Nation's News Trust
