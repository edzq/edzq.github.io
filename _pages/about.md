HiðŸ‘‹, I am currently a Computer Science Phd Candidate at the Computer and Information Sciences Department of Temple University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Eduard Dragut](https://cis.temple.edu/~edragut/index.htm).

My primary research interests are centered around natural language processing, large language models and machine learning. 
Specifically, I am working on developing high-performance information extraction models under low-resource scenarios using cost-effective techniques such as weak/distant supervision, semi-supervised learning, and in-context learning.
